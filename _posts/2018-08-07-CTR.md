### Goal  
The marketing team of an e-commerce site has launched an email campaign. They want to improve the click through rate. (CTR) 
The email is about the about a new feature implemented on the website. A success is if the user clicks on the link inside of the email. This link takes the user to the company site.

### Description of Data:
This data file has three tables,
"email_table", "email_open_table" and "link_clicked_table". Company collected the
date randomly. They have chosen a random sample of users and emailed them. 

### Research questions:   
This project aims to use machine learning to improve click rate. Question is to ask
how the click rate is associated with factors like hour, purchase history etc.   
   1. Perform Random Forest prediction to improve click rate    
   2. Look at actionable insights

### Analysis:

We have a funnel where steps are sequentia. We first check that data make sense, i.e all users who clicked actually opened it. 
Clean data and merge tables.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(rpart)
library(ggplot2)
librry(randomForest)

status=merge(open,click, by ='email_id', all.x=TRUE)
data=merge(email_table, status, by='email_id', all.x=TRUE)

str(data)
summary(data)
```

The summary table indicates US is the country we send the most marketing emails.
Email sent almost the same number every weekday. The average click is .02,
average open is 0.1. Data set looks good and no strange data point need to clean
now.   

Histogram shows that 8.27% of users opened the email 2.069% of users clicked on the
link within the email.

Before start building a machine-learning model, we check data relationship with click.   
Short email seems result in better click rate    
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ctr3.png" alt="summary of data">  

Emails send on Wednesday have better effect than other weekdays. Friday received fewer click response,   
it makes sense fewer people check email and click on weekend.      
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ctr4.png" alt="summary of data">  


UK (2.41%) has slightly higher click rate than US (2.38%), even US is the country
received most emails. ES (0.8%) and FR (0.7%) both have low click rate also they
have fewer emails received from the company. US it the market we need to pay
attention.

It seems that email sent at 23:00 PM, 24:00PM, 9:00-12:00AM work better. Fewer
people will click the link if emails send at 21:00PM.   
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ctr6.png" alt="summary of data">  

Users used to purchase at company website have much higher possibility to click
the link within email. Also, there is bug in data collection regards purchase item=21,
we remove this level.

I am going to pick random forest to predict the click rate. Then use partial
dependence plots and variable important graph to get insights of data. We split the
data set into training data set to train the data; and test data set to test our model.
Forest is built with 3 most important parameters. Factor “email_id” it is not relevant
we remove it. We check the model result below.
The OOB error are similar indicates we are not overfitting. 89% are predicted as
“not click”.     

```r
train_sample=sample(nrow(data), size=nrow(data)*0.66)
train_data = data(train_sample, -c(1,10)]
test_data = data[-train_sample, -c(1,10)]

rf=randomForest(y=train_Data$click, x=train_data[,-8],
                ytest=test-data$click, etext=test_data[,-8],
                ntreee=100, mtry=3, keep.frest=TRUE
rf                
```
           

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ctr8.png" alt="summary of data">  

Open is the most important factor by far. However, if users want to click the link
they have to open the email first. So, we consider remove it first.
If we want to improve click rate we have to improve open rate also. However, it
doesn’t mean open rate will necessary be affected by same factors as click rate, it
possible could be same. We will analyze open rate later.

We remove factor “open” and rebuild random forest.
Now hour is the most important factor. And 86% predict as “Not click”, accuracy
improved.

```r
rf=randomForest(y=train_Data$click, x=train_data[,-c(7,8)],
                ytest=test-data$click, etext=test_data[,-c(7,8)],
                ntreee=100, mtry=3, keep.frest=TRUE, classwt=c(0.6,0.4))
rf

varImPlot(rf, type=2)
```

Partial dependent plots show that   
   * Emails send at late evening and several hour before noon work better   
   * Users have purchase history are much better than new customers   
   * Emails send on Friday and weekend have fewer respond, other days are similar   
   * FR and ES are really bad, US and UK looks good   
   * Short mails work a little better than long emails   
   * Personalized version is better than generic version

A simple tree is built to check the 2 or 3 important segments.
```r
tree=rpart(data$click~., data[,-c(1,8,9,10)],
           control = rpart.control(minbucket = nrow(data)/100, maxdepth=3),
           parms=list(prior = c(0.6,0.4)))
tree
```

### Conclusion & Suggestions  
   1) Emails send around noon and late night result in good click rate and open rate. Emails send at early morning not contribute the both rate.   
   
   2) Friday and weekend, fewer people will open or click the link. Instead of sending same number of emails everyday, we can consider sending more emails on Monday & other days, fewer on weekend.   
   
   3) Users who have purchases history should be the group we ‘d like to send more emails. They are much more likely open the email and click the link.   
   
   4) US is the country we should pay attention. Majority email send to US, however, the click rate is same as UK which just received 1/3 emails as US.   
   
   *Regards the open rate, US is not the worst, but it is bad. More effort should make to figure out why US has low open rate.  
   For example, we can check the email title; email carrier; browser; content; sent time and so on. Also, ES and FR have low open and click rate, with fewer emails been sent. We can check the translation, the format of email title and so on. UK is a good market we can send more emails.*    
   
   5) Short emails with personalized style will help to improve the click rate.   
   
   6) Emails send at Monday 23:00PM in short text will get the best result.
