### Goal  
House prices play a big role in our life. 	What are the factors will determine the selling price of a house?  Floor size?  Number of bedrooms? Age of the house? Is the house near to school?
All these factors or variables seem reasonable to be considered.
We are interested in using a statistic model to do financial analysis 

### Description of Data:
This data file has 76 single family homes and 19 variables in Eugun, Oregon.

### Research questions:   
This project aims to construct a complete regression analysis of home price data for a city in Oregon.    
Use SAS and R to estimate the selling price based on sets of both numerical and categorical variables.


### Analysis:

The variables including Floor size, Number of bath rooms, number of bedrooms, year house built, Age of the house and so on. These data sets are numbers that we can use  directly.  So we call them numerical variables.

Other variables we have  are verbal description, we need to transform the verbal into numbers.    
We call them categorical variables.     
Like, the status of a house, is the house been sold? Pending sale, or under construction.     
Location is also verbal description. We consider the house price at Edison, Adams, Park as a reference. //// Weather these house near elementary school are also catergorical.       

In this step we transformed the verbal description into numbers as a part of data set.    
After that, we have set up a data file of numbers that is ready to use.

We have 19 variables in our data set, but not all of them has significant effect on house price. Some may not even reasonable to be considered.     

So, First, we need to do data clear. use pairwise test which generally said all the variables seem not correlated. Which means all factors are reasonable to be considered in constructing the model.

### Baseline Model   
$$E(Price) = b0 + b1Size + b2Lot + b3Bath + b4Bed + b5Age + b6Garage +  b7Active +  b8Edison + b9Harris + b10Adams + b11Crest + b12Parker $$

To make sure, we check factors’ VIF value. All VIF values are far from 10. And here,     
Which mathematically, supported the statement that all factors will be considered.    

In this step, SAS give the baseline model automatically.

### Probelm in thi smodel:   
But not all factors have significant effect on house price. We need modification by dropping and adding variables.

SAS Analysis suggest to drop number of bathroom and bedroom should drop. How this happen?    
We may think in this way, experience tells us if a house has four or five bedrooms, more than one bathroom have a positive impact on price of homes. 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/house5.png">      

In other case, if a house just has two or three bedrooms, adding bathrooms to homes would be a waste of space. In this way, the extra bathrooms have negative impact on price.    
Depends on these statements, we came up a way to solve this problem!
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/house6.png">      

When Bed=2, house price will decrease when bathroom number increased.  We have a red negative slope;
When Bed=3, the line is almost parallel; Bed=4 and 5, house price will increase while the bathroom number increase. 
Visually, all lines interacted at a point,   so we propose to add $$Bath x Bed =BathBed $$ in our model.    

SAS also suggested to drop variable  $$Age$$ .  The age of the house.    
However Drop Age seems not a good interpretation according to experience.   
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/house7.png">      

Let’s check relationship between price and Age by R, a curved pattern is noticed. But it should be a straight line.    
To attempt to correct this failing, we propose to add an Age2 item into the model.    

A curved pattern of Age doesn’t  necessarily mean that an Age2 transformation will correct this problem, but it is worth trying.

Looking a t the location variables, the verbal descriptions we have transformed into number. The test result showed,  among 6 locations, the house price in Adam and Crest are quite similar to each other, so we propose to drop them. and use Other 4 places  to replace as price reference. 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/house9.png">      

So far, from the preliminary analysis.  We proposed to add interaction and drop two location indicator to do modification.    
* Add :   Bath*Bed,  Age2    
* Drop location indicator : Adams, Crest     

We are wondering, weather proposed modification works?  We use Forward Selection and Backward Elimination to varify. It showed it is an a great idea to add age^2 and interaction.    
But three more factors should be dropped.    
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/house10.png">  
In this step we drop two more factors  $$Lot$$ and $$Parker$$ and keep $$Age$$.    

After dropping tow more factors, we test the model again, it showed all factors in our model now have significant effect on house price.

### Final Model

$$ E(Price) =  408.94+ 56.78Size -113.29Bath -87.71Bed + 32.56BedBath   
                       + 3.51Age +  2.72Age2 +16.46Garage+ 29.95Active 
                        +59.96Edison+ 32.24Harris  $$    
* Variables added: BedBath, Age2   
* Variables dropped:  Adams, Crest,Lot, Parker    
                         
After getting the final model,  analyst will do one more step to smooth the model take Log Transformation.  Since p-value is large whichi means the model is not significant.

### Conclusion & Suggestions  
   1) The most significant contribution we did is found the house prince is related to Age^2 and bath bed interaction.     
   2) Also, insignificant variables are drooped.  
   3) Last, we finished our project by giving a significant pricing model.
